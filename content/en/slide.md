As a team of more than 30 university students developing an exoskeleton for the **Cybathlon 2024**, we are united by a shared passion for innovation, technology, and the transformative potential of robotics to improve human lives.  

What motivates us most is the opportunity to create real change for people with disabilities while pushing the boundaries of what is technically possible in the field of robotics.  

Our commitment to **teamwork, collaboration, and excellence** drives us forward in designing and building an exoskeleton that is not only competitive but also embodies the values and spirit of our team.  

We are excited to present our hard work, dedication, and innovative spirit at the **Cybathlon 2024**. At the same time, we look with anticipation toward the future â€“ eager to discover how our journey will continue to shape both our team and the broader field of robotics.
