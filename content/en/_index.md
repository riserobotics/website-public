## We're creating exoskeletons for paraplegics!

In collaboration with the student initiative *Socially Engaged Engineers* (SEI), the Department of Medical Engineering at TU Berlin has launched RISE, an innovative and practice-oriented teaching module. The project’s mission is to enable people with spinal cord injuries to literally “rise up” and regain the ability to walk with the help of cutting-edge technology.  

At the heart of RISE is the development of a **robotic exoskeleton** – a state-of-the-art assistive device that combines engineering excellence with profound social impact. Working hand in hand with pilot participants, transdisciplinary teams of 25 to 50 students per semester design, build, and continuously refine the exoskeleton from the ground up.  

Through this initiative, students not only gain **hands-on experience** in research and development but also contribute directly to improving quality of life and independence for individuals affected by paralysis.  

RISE thus represents both a **technological challenge** and a **socially meaningful endeavor**, bringing together innovation, collaboration, and compassion in one forward-looking project.
